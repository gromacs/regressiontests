NOTE 1 [file grompp.mdp]:
  The group cutoff scheme is deprecated since GROMACS 5.0 and will be
  removed in a future release when all interaction forms are supported for
  the verlet scheme. The verlet scheme already scales better, and it is
  compatible with GPUs and other accelerators.


NOTE 2 [file grompp.mdp]:
  In hybrid Monte Carlo simulations, dynamic load balancing and PME tuning
  are turned off.


NOTE 3 [file grompp.mdp]:
  The current implementation of hybrid Monte Carlo only supports pure MD
  simulation. It does not support any type of enhanced sampling simulation
  (replica exchange, simulated tempering/expanded ensemble, FEP, pull
  code/umbrella sampling, ...) yet.


WARNING 1 [file grompp.mdp]:
  coulombtype = Switch is only for testing purposes and can lead to serious
  artifacts, advice: use coulombtype = Reaction-Field-zero


NOTE 4 [file grompp.mdp]:
  The switch/shift interaction settings are just for compatibility; you
  will get better performance from applying potential modifiers to your
  interactions!



NOTE 5 [file grompp.mdp]:
  For energy conservation with switch/shift potentials, rlist should be 0.1
  to 0.3 nm larger than rcoulomb.


NOTE 6 [file grompp.mdp]:
  You are using a cut-off for VdW interactions with NVE, for good energy
  conservation use vdwtype = Shift (possibly with DispCorr)

Velocities were taken from a Maxwell distribution at 0 K
Analysing residue names:
There are:   216      Water residues
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 1296.00

WARNING 2 [file grompp.mdp]:
  You are not using center of mass motion removal (mdp option comm-mode),
  numerical rounding errors can lead to build up of kinetic energy of the
  center of mass

Largest charge group radii for Van der Waals: 0.039, 0.039 nm
Largest charge group radii for Coulomb:       0.084, 0.084 nm

WARNING 3 [file grompp.mdp]:
  The sum of the two largest charge group radii (0.168872) is larger than
  rlist (0.800000) - rcoulomb (0.800000).
  With exact cut-offs, better performance can be obtained with
  cutoff-scheme = Verlet, because it does not use charge groups at all.

This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
