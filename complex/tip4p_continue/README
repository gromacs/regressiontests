Continue from checkpoint
    
This test checks that a simulation with tip4p water can be 
continued from a checkpoint file. For any Gromacs version newer 
then v2017 it also checks that reading in older checkpoint format
works. The checkpoint file is in single precision and is also used
for the double precision test.

The checkpoint file and reference values are generated with v2017.
