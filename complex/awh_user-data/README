Initialize AWH bias with user data.

Tests the reading of user data (awh[12]-init.xvg) used for initializing the bias.
The test case is alanine dipeptide in vaccum with one bias of a one-dimensional
dihedral angle coordinate and one bias on a two-dimensional dihedral-dihedral
coordinate. This also test reading into the periodic AWH grid.
