Hybrid Monte Carlo

The implementation of the hybrid Monte Carlo sampler consists of the
three classes HybridMCMDVelocities (provides initial velocities for
NVE runs), MetropolisStepMehlig (implements the Metropolis criterion),
and AcceptOrRewind (updates the simulation state). This short simulation
of alanine dipeptide in vacuum tests whether the three classes interact
correctly and whether they are embedded correctly in the main MD loop.
