This system tests the nonbonded NxN kernel with Lorentz-Berthelot combination
rules (only relevant for x86 SIMD kernels), virtual sites and pressure
coupling. This means the vsite OpenMP code is also tested.

Forces and velocities are not compared because they are not reprodicible within
tolerance. This test does not work with MPI parallelization.
