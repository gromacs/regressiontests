You can only run the tests if you have sourced the GMXRC file.
	
For the kernel tests, reference states were calculated with the double
precision C loops in Gromacs 3.3, after making sure the results were
identical to those of Gromacs 3.2. Software invsqrt was not used.

For the other tests, the reference is gromacs 3.3.2. The tests are run
on an Apple with Intel hardware, using the C-version of the loops:

setenv NOASSEMBLYLOOPS 1

The code was compiled using gcc with the following 
CFLAGS "-O0 -float-store"
