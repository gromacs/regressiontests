You can only run the tests if you have sourced the GMXRC file.
	
For the kernel tests, reference states were calculated with the double
precision C loops in Gromacs 3.3, after making sure the results were
identical to those of Gromacs 3.2. Software invsqrt was not used.

For the other tests, the reference is gromacs 3.3.2. The tests are run
on an Apple with Intel hardware, using the C-version of the loops:

setenv NOASSEMBLYLOOPS 1

The code was compiled using gcc with the following 
CFLAGS "-O0 -float-store"

Update 2009-05-25: Big thanks to Mark Abraham for working through all 
the test sets and providing patches to make sure they don't generate
bogus errors for the latest Gromacs version.

Update 2009-08-08: More fixes and updates from Mark Abraham. 

* All reference states were recalculated from GROMACS installations
configured as 

./configure --enable-double --disable-software-sqrt CFLAGS="-O0 -ffloat-store" 

and run with environment variable NOASSEMBLYLOOPS set to 1. The compiler was 
gcc 4.1.2 20070626 (Red Hat 4.1.2-13) running on Pentium III hardware. 
Buckingham kernel tests were calculated with GROMACS 4.0.5 (because of the 
Buckingham/LJ-14 bug in 3.3.x), other kernel tests with GROMACS 3.3, most 
other tests with GROMACS 3.3.2, and tests of functionality introduced in 4.0 
with GROMACS 4.0.5.

* All .mdp files reverted to those created by DvdS, (i.e. per git cc5379438706044faabedbc83bd2e3b8dbecfe42)

* "tcoupl = yes" changed to "tcoupl = Berendsen"

* "ns-type = simple" changed to "ns-type = grid"
