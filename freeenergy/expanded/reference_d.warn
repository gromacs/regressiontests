WARNING 1 [file grompp.mdp]:
  The switching range for PME-Switch should be 5% or less, energy
  conservation will be good anyhow, since ewald_rtol = 1e-06

WARNING 2 [file grompp.mdp]:
  You are not using center of mass motion removal (mdp option comm-mode),
  numerical rounding errors can lead to build up of kinetic energy of the
  center of mass
