WARNING 1 [file grompp.mdp]:
  With coulomb soft core, the reciprocal space calculation will not
  necessarily cancel.  It may be necessary to decrease the reciprocal space
  energy, and increase the cutoff radius to get sufficiently close matches
  to energies with free energy turned off.

WARNING 2 [file topol.top, line 71]:
  Some parameters for bonded interaction involving perturbed atoms are
  specified explicitly in state A, but not B - copying A to B
